# Ideas

## Scripts Field Expressions
Since the goal is to deprecate python dict like files as the data 
scripts, a type of expression for the fields becomes necessary

### Idea 1
Perhaps implement a set of Python AST that allows redirection
of variables for example


### Idea 2
Create a whole custom expression interpreter, if it is not heavy
to maintain
